###Cat Fu Training Grounds###
In this project we will be working with JavaScript and CSS animations to practice using event listeners and the setTimeout method.

###Objective###
To create a simple application using JavaScript and CSS to understand the functionality of event listeners. CSS animations will be used as visual cues when the event listeners are triggered.

###Prerequisites###
In order to complete this project students must have the following:
* Basic understanding of JavaScript and DOM
* Basic understanding of CSS and animations

###Requirements###
To complete this project you will need the following:
* Sublime Text

###Desired Outcome###
At the completion of this exercise, students should understand:
* Event listeners
* setTimeout() method
* Class and Javascript

###Your Challenge###
1. Create an *app.js* file.
2. Reference the *app.js* file in the *index.html* file.
3. **addEventListener()**s in the *app.js* file.
  * Cat fighter on the left tree branch listens for a *click* event when the mouse is clicked on the **X** target. On mouse click cat fighter learns the class *kicking*.
  * Cat figher on the right tree branch listens for a *mousedown* to power up and learn the class *fly*. Cat figher also needs to listen for *mouseup* to stop power up.
  * Cat figher on the ground listens for a *keydown*, specifically for the *spacebar* so that cat figher can learn classes *fire* and *energy*.
4. **setTimeout()** is a powerful method for cat fighters to learn their class.
